To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.
This software suite will be broken into three parts :
• An application server to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
• A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
• A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server


## Build

- server run on localhost:8080
